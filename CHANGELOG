0.5.0
	- Web Console available online @ http://hypermove.net/pythonium-web-console/
	- Fix runtests.py: avoid envoy, made it work on Windows (Peter Ljunglöf)
	- Clean up main function (Peter Ljunglöf)
	- Fixed namespaced method definitions. Previously defining a method FOO would override any previous definition of function FOO.
	- Rework from ... import ... and import ...
	- Renamed ``JS`` function to ``jscode``
	- ``new`` function as a new syntax ``new(Date)(1, 2, 3)`` cf. https://github.com/pythonium/pythonium/commit/a423709102338b084d669075b0ffa439beb0abfa
	- added ``jstype`` function which returns a javascript objects equivalent to Python object (missing implementation for list and dict)
	- ``print`` was defined in ``lib/builtins.py`` and must be used to log Python objects. ``console.log(fuuuu)`` must be used to log JavaScript objects.
	- rework ``dict`` so that it works more like CPython one.
